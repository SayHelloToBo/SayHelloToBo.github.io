            When working with small to medium size teams, my role usually ends up wearing multiple hats throughout the project. It is a balancing act that usually places me working closely with business, ux, and production teams.

            Clarifying the business needs for a product with stakeholders pays huge dividends throughout the development lifecycle. So I like to start new projects by interviewing business stakeholders to make sure they have aligned on their business goals for the project. If they’re not, I facilitate an alignment workshop.

            Over the years I have been developing and refining a technique to help me guide business stakeholders in goal setting for their projects. Lately I’ve been calling it the Business Value Matrix (BVM). Its a quick way to determine what stage the company is at during the project and narrow down the types of goals the company should be pursuing.

          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mv3">
            When I was brought onto the project there was only an informal backlog of work to be done. Some tasks were stored in an excel file that might have been passed around, while other tasks might only be found in someone’s notebook; or worse, someone’s memory. So the first task I took on was to create a ‘single source of truth’ for completed, ongoing, and future work. I constructed a new backlog.

          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            I used this into an opportunity for ‘onboarding’ to the project. It allowed me to better understand the state of the project. It also would give me the background knowledge to be able to speak candidly with stakeholders about what to expect for the upcoming work on the project.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            Getting all the major stakeholders in the same room at the same time is on easy task, but somehow we were able to pull it off for the formal kickoff meeting the project. I used part of that meeting time to try to get everyone aligned to a set of goals for the project. Getting that level of cohesion amongst the key players would pay huge dividends throughout project’s life.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            With a clear goal in mind, I was able to follow up with the representative running point on the project for the company. And together we went through and organized the backlog in a way that was more oriented towards our goal. For instance, we went through the backlog and identified chunks of work that were not going to be as highly valued as others based on their goal for the project. We could prioritize the work at a more granular level because it was clearer what work was going to create value and what work would not create as much value.

          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            The development team was already in place before I joined the project. Just as I needed to understand the state of the work to do on the project, I also needed to understand the culture of development on this team in order to build a project plan that aligned with how they work; or, ideally, how they would like to work.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            So the first step to getting started with development was to host a retrospective. I met with the developers and designers to understand how they work and what potential roadblocks were already present in their process. There were themes that emerged from this process. The team wanted clearer specifications of work and more predictable work days so they could manage their time and feel like the features they completed were well done.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            Sometimes speed is an issue, but in my experience uncertainty is the real driver of angst. Uncertainty is a direct measure of risk, whereas speed is at best indirectly driving risk. Unfortunately, decision makers will sometimes unknowingly articulate their need for less uncertainty by demanding faster results.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            I try to have this conversation early in the project with stakeholders and the development team so that we understand what really drives successful projects is consistency, not speed. Delivering consistently puts minds at ease because everyone around the boardroom table can manage their expectations of completed work. Doing work faster is meaningless if you’ve lost twice as much time fixing defects or incomplete features. That’s why I work towards a balance between building things right and building things fast.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            I address consistency in this project by using point based estimating as an alternative to hour based estimating. I facilitated a session with the development team to estimate how large the features were relative to other features in the backlog. This is a common agile technique and it worked fine for this project.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            Now I had a backlog with features that were rated with relative value and relative size. This allowed me to do some interesting analysis of the features by placing them on a matrix of value to size.
          </p>

          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            We returned to the backlog periodically in preparation for upcoming development cycles. It was a nice way to do real-time planning that could incorporate changes in priority (value) of features and more realistic sizing of features after the team had more experience building out features for the project.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            Moreover, I was able to build up an intuition about the average amount of work the development team could accomplish after they completed a few development cycles. I used that average to determine how much the team could consistently deliver during a development cycle. This helped a lot when communicating back with stakeholders about progress and outlook for the project. It also helped stakeholders understand what was possible to get done in their project over time. This naturally made them more selective about priorities for features and facilitated more productive conversations about what we should do next.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            One of the common issues with specifications is that they are either too hard for the development team to understand or too hard for the business stakeholders to understand. My job is to find the balance so that communication is possible. I do this by communicating specs with a technical format, but using the language of the business. This is a very common technique in teams that use agile/bdd conventions.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            The main goal of this project was to for the company to reduce the amount of time necessary to track performance while the company rapidly grows into new markets. We could further break this goal down into two subgoals: supervisors can collect data more efficiently and the operations director can generate reports more efficiently.

            Part of the benefit of estimating the size of items in the backlog is being able to determine which items will need to be broken down into something smaller. Part of my role in this project was to help break down the work into something more manageable for the team to deliver. So I made sure to look for ways to break this down during our design phase.

          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            With the help of a couple of the stakeholders I was able to break down this activity into 2 major tasks that operations directors would need to complete: viewing performance and sharing reports. I was able to further break this down.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
            I was able to determine some high-level scope of what tasks would need to be involved with this activity. I communicated them as a graph of tasks to show their relevance to the overall goal we were trying to achieve.
